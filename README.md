# Alcofit
An Artificial Intelligence project (harmony search algorithm)

Written in cooperation with a friend of mine as a homework in Ruby.

The problem is that we have an box where we want to fit as much of pure alcohol as we can. All the bottles are generated randomly by a class. There is not any interface - change variable's values to change the results.

**Warning!** The code and comments are in polish.
